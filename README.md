# Web Accessibility is for everyone
    When talking about web accessibility, the first thing which comes to mind is visual
    impairement. Although that's mostly true, we all need the web to be accessible regardless of 
    any impairment whether temporary or permanent or  wether we prefer to use keyboard over mouse
    - Temporary impairment: 
        - Fell and injured arm
        - Medication side effects causing tremors
        
    - Permanent impairment:
        - Vision impairment: for aging parents with low vision or due to disease like glaucoma
        - Motor impairment (Parkinson's disease, Muscular dystrophy, etc.)
        - Auditory impairment 
        - Cognitive impairment making it more difficult to process information
            - ex: dyslexia
           
    - Everyday circumstances:
        - Holding a toddler in one arm while working from home
        - Holding the phone in one hand while placing order online

    As a designer, developer, our goal is to reach far wide as possible to our target audience and
    making their experience online smooth and less frustrating.
